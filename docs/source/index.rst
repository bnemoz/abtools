AbTools: Utilities for antibody sequence analysis
===================================================================


AbTools provides core data structures and methods for analysis of 
antibody repertoire data. Tools for manipulating sequences, pairwise
and multiple sequence alignment and sequence clustering are included.

Additionally, AbTools provides utilities for secondary analysis of 
antibody sequence data. Error correction, mining NGS datasets for sequences 
with similarity to known antibody sequences, generating lineage phylogenies, 
and making repertoire-level comparisons are all covered.
