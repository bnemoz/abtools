AbTools is a package of several tools for performing common antibody repertoire analysis functions:  
`AbCorrect` corrects sequencing errors using either molecular barcodes or homology-based clustering  
`AbFinder` identifies sequences from NGS datasets with similarity to known antibody sequences  
`AbPhylogeny` generates publication-quality phylogentic trees from antibody sequences  
`AbCompare` provides methods for repertoire-level comparison of antibody sequence data
