# abtools  
  
AbTools is a package of several tools for performing common functions in antibody repertoire analysis: AbCorrect, which corrects sequencing errors using either molecular barcodes or homology-based clustering; AbFinder, which identifies sequences from NGS datasets with similarity to known antibody sequences; AbPhylogeny, which generates publication-quality phylogentic trees from antibody sequences; and AbCompare, which provides methods for repertoire-level comparison of antibody sequence data.
